# 👋 Hi, I'm Shifaul  

I’m a tech-driven engineer with a Bachelor’s in Aerospace Engineering from the Singapore Institute of Technology. My journey blends hands-on engineering with digital transformation — where I’ve led and supported projects integrating **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **IoT-based systems** to enhance aerospace **Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO)** operations.  

During my time at **ST Engineering Aerospace**, I spearheaded the development of an **AR solution for the shopfloor**, bridging field operations with digital tools to reduce downtime and improve workflow efficiency by 25%. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams taught me how technology isn’t just about innovation — it’s about **making processes smarter, safer, and more human-centric**.  

That experience deepened my curiosity in **data-driven decision-making**, **smart manufacturing**, and **AI applications** that redefine how industries operate. I’m passionate about turning technical complexity into practical, scalable solutions that drive real impact.  

Outside of engineering, I’m continuously learning — exploring emerging tech like **AI, cloud systems, and data analytics**, while enjoying moments of balance through fitness, exploration, and creative projects.  

💡 *I believe meaningful innovation happens when curiosity meets purpose — and that’s the energy I bring to every team I join.*

# 👋 Hi, I'm Shifaul 

I’m an **Aerospace Engineering graduate** passionate about the intersection of **technology, data, and innovation**. My experience at **ST Engineering Aerospace** allowed me to work hands-on with **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **IoT-based smart maintenance systems**, where I streamlined operations, improved efficiency, and collaborated closely with cross-functional engineering teams.

I thrive in fast-paced, problem-solving environments — whether it’s **building data-driven solutions**, **optimizing processes**, or **integrating emerging technologies** into real-world systems. I’m constantly learning and enjoy tackling technical challenges that create meaningful impact.

When I’m not working on engineering or tech projects, you’ll find me exploring new tools in **AI, automation, and data visualization**, or brainstorming ways to improve user-focused digital solutions.
